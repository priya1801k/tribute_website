        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            <ul class="set">
                <li>Hailing from a background of high academic standards, KL Rahul was born and brought up in the prestigious National Institute of Technology, Karnataka, where his father is a professor in the department of Civil Engineering. He finished his schooling in NITK and grew to develop keen interest in cricket. Having started off with batting on the grass-less field of the college, Rahul's parents spotted a spark in him and decided that he must receive formal training in order to realize his talents.</li>
                <li>Rahul rose through the ranks of Under-19 cricket and broke into the Karnataka first-class side and had a decent debut season in 2010-11. He was left out of the squad for the succeeding season, but he returned for the 2012-13 season, in which he had a prolific run of form, becoming the highest run-getter of the season, propelling himself into contention for the highest honour of them all â€“ an India Test cap.</li>
                <li>KL Rahul, the man who made his Test debut just ahead of the 2015 World Cup, has grown exponentially in limited-overs cricket over the last few years since the 2015 World Cup. Despite scoring a hundred in the T20I format (apparently whilst inebriated), and earning himself a nine-figure IPL paycheque, Rahul has struggled to establish himself in the ODI game, particularly due to a top-order that is already established and a consequent inability to grasp his role in the middle-order. He has had several failures at the number 4 spot, but he made a case for himself in the 2019 IPL to be considered as a mature accumulator in the middle-order along with his hitting abilities - not to mention being one of the highest run-scorers in the tournament. Rahul, who was also a part of the Koffee with Karan controversy, has had a tough path back to the World Cup squad, after a run of poor form in the longer format in 2018, and off-field issues. However, he has exhibited his reserves of mental strength over the last few months and would be relieved and eager as he boards the flight to England</li>
